**Project Title:** *Recursive Factorial Calculator*

**Description:**
This project implements a simple yet efficient **recursive algorithm** in Python to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.
The program prompts the user for input, processes it using a recursive function `factorial(n)`, and returns the result.
It demonstrates core programming concepts such as **recursion, input handling**, and **mathematical computation**, making it a fundamental example for understanding algorithm design and function calls in Python.
